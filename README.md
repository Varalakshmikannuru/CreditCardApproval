# Credit Card Approval Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting the approval of credit card applications using machine learning classification algorithms. The dataset contains information about applicants such as their income type, education level, family status, and job title, among others. The main goal is to build a predictive model that can classify applications as "Approved" or "Rejected" based on these features.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values, duplicate records, and encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`.
  - Scaled the feature data using `MinMaxScaler` for optimal performance of machine learning models.
  
- **Class Imbalance Handling**:
  - Used `RandomOverSampler` to address the imbalance in the target variable (Approval Status).

- **Modeling**:
  - Built multiple classification models including:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree Classifier
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - Extra Trees Classifier
    - K-Nearest Neighbors
    - Gaussian Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Classifier

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy)
  - Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
  - ROC-AUC Score and Curve

## Data Description

The dataset used is called `Application_Data.csv`, which contains the following key attributes:
- `Applicant_Gender`: Gender of the applicant
- `Income_Type`: Type of income source
- `Education_Type`: Level of education
- `Family_Status`: Family background of the applicant
- `Housing_Type`: Applicant's housing condition
- `Job_Title`: Job designation of the applicant
- `Status`: Target variable representing credit card approval status (1: Approved, 0: Rejected)

## Model Performance

Each model is evaluated based on various performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and MCC. ROC-AUC curves are plotted for a visual comparison of model performance.

## Results

The best-performing model is selected based on the balance of accuracy, recall, and precision. Below are the evaluation metrics and ROC-AUC scores for each model:

| Model                     | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Specificity | MCC | ROC-AUC Score |

| Decision Tree Classifier    | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx       | xx%         | xx  | xx            |
| Random Forest Classifier    | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx       | xx%         | xx  | xx            |
| Extra Trees Classifier      | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx       | xx%         | xx  | xx            |
| K-Nearest Neighbors         | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx       | xx%         | xx  | xx            |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes        | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx       | xx%         | xx  | xx            |
| Support Vector Classifier   | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx       | xx%         | xx  | xx            |
